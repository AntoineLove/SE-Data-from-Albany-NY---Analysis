# Socioeconomic Data from Albany, NY - Analysis

You'll find an ipynb file for:
- Decision Tree Classification (poor results, sadly), and
- KNN Classification.

The classification was done in an attempt to recover features used in the decision making process for, 'where to place free food fridges in Albany, NY'.  Several pairings and triples of SE data were found to classify potential neighborhoods and some accuracies were found above 84% - about 3% higher than classifying all neighborhoods as 'do not put a fridge here'.  

The features found which classify most accurately do affirm that marginalized people groups are the targets for the free food fridges.  This is an encouraging finding.
